multiSA (**Multi-Stock Assessment with Regional Spatiotemporal
dynamics**) is a multi-stock, spatially-explicit age-structured model.

With explicit seasonal stock availability and movement, multiSA is
intended for use in mixed fisheries where stock composition can not be
readily identified in fishery data alone, i.e., from catch and
age/length composition. Models can also be fitted to genetic data, e.g.,
stock composition of catches and close-kin pairs.

Funding for development of multiSA is provided by the NOAA Fisheries
Bluefin Tuna Research Program
([BTRP](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/grant/bluefin-tuna-research-program)
Grants NA23NMF4720184 and NA24NMFX472C0008-T1-01) in collaboration with
the Ocean Foundation.

Atlantic bluefin tuna (*Thunnus thynnus*) is the first intended case
study.
